# ðŸ¤° Maternal Health Risk Predictor

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts maternal health risk (Low, Mid, or High) based on six clinical parameters. It uses a machine learning model (XGBoost) trained on a maternal health dataset, enhanced with data preprocessing, class balancing, and SHAP for model explainability.

## Features

- Interactive web UI for health data input
- Risk prediction using a trained XGBoost model
- SHAP plots showing feature contribution for each prediction
- Scaled input via StandardScaler to match training conditions

- Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- Blood Sugar (mmol/L)
- Body Temperature (Â°F)
- Heart Rate (beats per minute)
